# SCALT: automatic identification of cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing data
SCALT (Single Cell Annotation Likelihood Tool) is an innovative method which introduces a paradigm-shift for the analysis of scRNAseq data. In this approach, cells are annotated to a specific type at individual level, by using a simple but elegant method based on maximum likelihood, without the need for clustering, dimensionality reduction or manual annotation. SCALT leverages a collection of 471 lists of cell-type specific genes, constructed by extensive re-analysis of comprehensive and expert curated catalogues (HPA and DISCO).

## Conda installation
SCALT requires the installation of Conda and the creation of the respective environment.
